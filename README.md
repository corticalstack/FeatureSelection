# 🔍 Feature Selection Techniques

A Python implementation of various feature selection methods for machine learning, demonstrated using the wine dataset.

## 📚 Description

This repository provides a comprehensive demonstration of different feature selection techniques in machine learning. Feature selection is a crucial step in the ML pipeline that helps identify the most relevant features, reducing dimensionality while maintaining or improving model performance.

The implementation uses the wine dataset from scikit-learn as an example to showcase how different feature selection methods work and compare their results.

## ✨ Features

- **Univariate Feature Selection**: Statistical tests (Chi-squared) to select features with the strongest relationship with the output variable
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Recursively removes features and builds a model on those remaining, selecting features by recursively considering smaller sets
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction technique that transforms features into a new set of uncorrelated variables
- **Feature Importance with Tree-based Models**:
  - Extra Trees Classifier for feature ranking
  - Random Forest Classifier for feature ranking

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why is feature selection important?**  
A: Feature selection helps improve model accuracy, reduce overfitting, decrease training time, and enhance model interpretability by removing irrelevant or redundant features.

**Q: Which feature selection method should I use?**  
A: It depends on your specific use case. Filter methods (like Chi-squared) are fast but don't consider feature interactions. Wrapper methods (like RFE) consider interactions but are computationally expensive. Embedded methods (like tree-based importance) offer a good balance.
